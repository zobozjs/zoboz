# Why You Should Avoid the `type` Field in `package.json`

Your `package.json` currently includes a `type` field, which can threaten the compatibility of your package across different environments.

## Why Is It Harmful?

When the `type` field is set, it alters how Node.js interprets your files, potentially causing unexpected behavior with the `main` and `module` fields.

- **If `type` is set to `module`:**
  
  - The `main` field may be ignored, and only the `module` field will be respected.
  - The `main` field may be mistakenly read by ES Module dependents, since the package has stated it is following ES Module.
  - This can break compatibility for tools or environments expecting CommonJS modules.

- **If `type` is set to `commonjs`:**
  
  - The `module` field may be ignored, and only the `main` field will be used.
  - This can disrupt compatibility with tools expecting ES modules.

- **Tooling and Ecosystem Confusion:**
  
  - Some bundlers, linters, or testing frameworks may not fully respect or understand the `type` field, leading to inconsistent behavior across environments.
  - Tools like Webpack or Babel might misinterpret how to handle file extensions (`.js` vs `.cjs`/`.mjs`), causing build errors or runtime issues.

## Recommendation

If you don't explicitly need to define the `type`, consider removing it. This helps ensure that both `main` and `module` fields function as intended, maintaining broader compatibility with different environments and tooling.
