# Why You Should Avoid the `type` Field in `package.json`

The `type` field in `package.json` can cause unintended compatibility issues across different module systems. While it may seem like a simple setting, it can impact how Node.js, bundlers, and other tools interpret your package.

## Why Is It Harmful?

### 1. It Alters Module Resolution Unexpectedly
When you set `"type": "module"`, Node.js assumes all `.js` files are ESM, which can break CommonJS consumers expecting `.js` to be CommonJS.

- **ESM Consumers**: May mistakenly treat CommonJS as an ES module.
- **CommonJS Consumers**: May fail to import files correctly.

Likewise, setting `"type": "commonjs"` forces everything to be treated as CommonJS, which can create issues when trying to support both module types.

### 2. It Interferes with the `main` and `module` Fields
Many libraries specify `main` and `module` fields for compatibility:

```json
{
  "main": "./dist/cjs/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/esm/index.js"
}
```

When `type` is set, Node.js may ignore one of these fields depending on context, breaking compatibility for some consumers.

### 3. Tooling Conflicts
Not all tools interpret `type` consistently:

- **Webpack, Babel, and TypeScript**: May not respect `type`, leading to incorrect bundling or transpilation.
- **ESLint and other linters**: May apply incorrect rules.
- **Testing frameworks**: May fail to properly resolve modules.

## Recommendation

Unless absolutely necessary, **remove the `type` field** and instead use explicit file extensions (`.cjs` and `.mjs`) to define module types. This avoids ambiguity and ensures compatibility across all environments.

For more details, refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_type).
