# Zoboz: Streamline Your Package Builds

Building and distributing JavaScript/TypeScript libraries can be a complex task. Zoboz simplifies this process, ensuring your packages are compatible, efficient, and ready for publication.

## What is Zoboz?

Zoboz is a suite of tools designed to automate and enhance your package build process. It offers:

- **Automated Builds**: Generate TypeScript declarations (`.d.ts`), ES modules (esm), and CommonJS modules (cjs) effortlessly.
- **Post-Build Enhancements**: Optimize your distribution files and `package.json` for maximum compatibility.
- **Educational Resources**: Learn best practices and apply them manually if you prefer full control.

## Choose Your Path

Depending on your project's needs, Zoboz offers three approaches:

1. **Fully Automated**: Utilize `@zoboz/core` for an all-in-one solution.
2. **Flexible Post-Build**: Integrate `@zoboz/bam` for customizable post-build enhancements.
3. **Manual Control**: Access our learning resources to implement best practices yourself.
